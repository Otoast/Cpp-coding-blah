// (singly) Linked list: way fo modelling finite sequence
    // Data in linked list is stored in nodes, scattered throughout memory
    // Each node has a pointer (link) to next node in the list
    // last node will have a link to a nullptr

// Linked List Terminology:
    // Head: first node in linked list 
        // No other node points to it
    // Tail: final node in linked list
        // Links to a nullptr
